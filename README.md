Project Ellen

Project Overview
This project was developed as part of the Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) course to demonstrate the principles of object-oriented design in a custom game level. The game level is created using the GameLib library (version 2.6.1) and is inspired by the visual style of the classic Alien Breed game. The map for the level was designed using the Tiled editor.

The main goal of the project is to create an interactive, non-linear playable game level where players must solve a series of challenges by interacting with various actors and utilizing adventure-based mechanics.
